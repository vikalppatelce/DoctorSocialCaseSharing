	Select the list you want to manage at the top of the screen.<br/><br/>

To add a value to the list, type the value in the text box at the bottom and click on the <a href="">+</a> button<br/><br/>

To delete any value, simply click on the <a href="">- </a>button in front of those values.<br/><br/>

For first time users, a lot of values in the Lists will auto-load from the server once you register and sign in.  If you are an existing user but  just installed this app on a new phone, logging in will sync the lists from the server just like your older device.<br/><br/>
